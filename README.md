# Coveed BackEnd Service
This is the backend for the coveed project see front end here https://github.com/stanislaus-onwuka/kill-covid-frontend.

``Coveed is a remote health guide that helps patients (who can be classified as patients with mild symptoms of the Covid19 infection) in their self-isolation routine.``

# Who can use Coveed
✅ tested patients (with minimal symptoms) who wish to self isolate.

✅ People who suspect that they have been infected, and are experiencing mild symptoms.

# How it Works
✅ A user signs up and he gets to add his symptoms on a daily basis to the app, and the app records that data over the space of two weeks.

✅ The data is then sent to a review staging area.where a certified medical practioner (MP) can review the progress of the patient based on his/her medical history. The MP can recommend that the patient stays on the app for an extra two weeks in isolation or schedule a test for the patient , and can as well flag a patient for emergency.

✅ While a patient is on the app the patient can willingly contact emergency, and will consent to having his location revealed to health agencies, and be picked up to a proper isolation center if he observes that he's unstable.

# Benefits of Coveed
✅ It eases the tension on the medical system , since lots of cases can be addressed remotely

✅ lowers the chances of  front-liners in this war against Covid19 - getting infected 

✅ More cases can be brought under the radar, lots of people here in Nigeria , are either afraid to go for tests or ignorant, with this we can keep an eye on them.
